# Contributing

If you have a fix or enhancement you'd like to contribute, please feel free to open a Pull Request.
Bugs can be reported via the Issues page on GitHub.

Regex is intentionally small and focused, so please keep that in mind when proposing changes.
If you're unsure whether a change is appropriate, you can open an Issue to dicuss the change.

Where possible, all changes to source code should be accompanied by tests.

For more information about getting started with the code, take a look at the [development setup guide](README.md#development-setup).
